# CloudCone WHMCS Module #

Our WHMCS module provides an automated solution for provisioning compute servers through WHMCS allowing you to offer them to your clients. The module allows you to provision servers either on our public cloud (where you would normally provision servers) or on a [private hypervisor](https://cloudcone.com/private/).
